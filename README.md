## Description
*Dhanvantari rose out of the water with his four hands, holding a pot full of elixirs!*

Gen AI can transform medicine but needs a framework for collaborative research and practice. Dhanvantari is a reference architecture for such a framework that integrates an EMR (OpenMRS), Gen AI application server (LangServe), self-hosted LLMs (Ollama), vector store (redis), monitoring (LangFuse), FHIR data repository (HAPI) and a graph database (Neo4j) in one docker-compose. Dhanvantari is inspired by Bhamini and aims to facilitate GenAI adoption and research in areas with low resources. 

Dhanvantari supports installable Gen AI routines through LangServe templates called **elixirs** and installable UI elements through OpenMRS O3 React container (called **conch shell**). It uses Medprompt for base classes and Fhiry for FHIR processing.
