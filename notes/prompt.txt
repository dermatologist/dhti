Give me 5 questions a doctor can find from a electronic health record.
Create them as if you are a doctor looking for information on a particular patient.
Each question should be brief and answerable with a value or short phrase.
Questions should be answerable from a written record and not by asking.
The questions should be in an array as strings.
Return only the array with the questions.
